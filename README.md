# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Something that I would improve in this project is adding a fixed header that stays in place when you scroll though the page. The header would include the title of the coffee shop and the navigation bar. Also I would include a gallery section with pictures of items on the menu as well as pictures of the coffee shop interior and baristas making coffee. I personally feel like it would not only build an expectation and bring it to life but also intrigue the user to try the coffee shop.
